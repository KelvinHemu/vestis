VESTIS – Core Value 
1. Problem
Online clothing businesses face a significant trust gap caused by inadequate product visualization. Customers struggle to accurately imagine how garments will fit, drape, and appear in real-life situations when products are presented using flat-lay images or mannequins. These basic visual formats fail to convey essential details such as body fit, fabric movement, and overall style, leading to hesitation and uncertainty during purchase decisions. As a result, many potential buyers abandon the buying process, severely limiting conversion rates and weakening customer confidence in online fashion platforms.
This challenge is particularly costly for clothing businesses in Tanzania, where the lack of relatable and realistic visual representation contributes to the loss of up to 40% of potential online sales. While professional model photoshoots could address this issue, they are often prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and logistically demanding. Existing AI-powered visualization tools are largely inaccessible due to high costs, foreign language interfaces, and limited local relevance. Consequently, businesses are left without affordable, practical solutions to bridge the visualization trust gap, constraining growth and competitiveness in the digital fashion market.
 






2. Solution
What Vestis Offers:
 The proposed solution is a digital platform designed to unlock online clothing sales by restoring customer trust through authentic, locally relevant visual content. The platform enables clothing businesses to create high-quality, aesthetic product images that realistically showcase garment fit, drape, and style. Instead of relying on flat-lay photos or expensive studio shoots, businesses can present their products on real people, allowing customers to better visualize how clothing appears in everyday life, thereby increasing confidence and purchase intent.
The platform uniquely leverages local and influential individuals as models, ensuring cultural relevance and relatability for Tanzanian consumers. It is intentionally built for low-tech users, featuring a simple, intuitive interface that requires minimal technical skills or resources. By prioritizing affordability, ease of use, and adaptability, the solution remains simple to adopt, locally grounded in design, and scalable across regions, making it accessible to small and medium fashion businesses while supporting long-term growth.
3. Value Creation
The platform creates value by directly addressing affordability, trust, and usability barriers faced by clothing businesses. By offering the most affordable subscription model in the market, it enables small and medium fashion sellers to access high-quality product visuals without the prohibitive costs associated with professional photoshoots or international platforms. The use of real, local models increases customer relatability and trust, resulting in higher conversion rates and reduced cart abandonment. Unlike AI-generated or generic imagery, the visuals reflect real body types, local styles, and cultural context, making products feel authentic and credible to buyers.
Additionally, the platform delivers operational value by drastically reducing time and complexity. Businesses can generate trusted visual content within less than 72 hours, compared to weeks of planning for traditional shoots. The simplified three-click booking process removes technical and logistical barriers, allowing even low-tech users to create professional-grade visuals. Together, these benefits translate into increased sales, lower marketing costs, reduced risk of unsold inventory, and stronger brand trust, establishing the platform’s unique value proposition: Real. Local. Trusted.

4. Value Delivery
Value is delivered through a simple, accessible digital platform designed for local users. The system allows businesses to use models, submit product details, and receive finished visual content through an intuitive interface that requires minimal technical knowledge. The platform supports local languages, eliminating the language barriers commonly found in international AI tools and global platforms. This ensures inclusive access for sellers who may be unfamiliar with complex digital systems or English-based interfaces.
To maximize speed and reliability, the platform follows a streamlined, end-to-end workflow, choosing the models , uploading the clothing images  and content creation to final delivery, all managed digitally. Businesses receive ready-to-use product images optimized for online stores and social media within a short turnaround time. By combining affordability, ease of use, and fast delivery, the platform ensures that value is not only created but consistently and efficiently delivered, making it a practical and scalable solution for the local fashion ecosystem.
 
5. Value Capture
How Vestis Benefits:
Vestis captures value through a diversified and scalable revenue model designed to support both early-stage adoption and long-term growth. The primary revenue stream is seller subscriptions, offered through tiered monthly plans tailored to different business sizes and content needs. These plans include TZS 4,999 (Starter), TZS 14,999 (Professional), and TZS 29,999 (Business), with pricing structured around image generation volume. This approach ensures affordability for small vendors while enabling predictable recurring revenue as usage scales.
Additional value is captured through transaction-based commissions, where Vestis earns a 1.5% fee on sales completed via Vestis-powered storefronts for merchants who integrate the platform into their sales channels. For larger organizations, Vestis offers enterprise licensing through white-label API access, allowing major e-commerce platforms and fashion marketplaces to embed Vestis’ visual content capabilities directly into their systems. To lower entry barriers, a freemium model provides vendors with 10 free images per month, encouraging experimentation and trust while creating a natural upgrade path as businesses grow and demand increases.
